# FitTracker React App

Official link:
https://www.fittracker.fit/

This React app was created as a project to test my JavaScript, CSS, HTML and REACT knowledge.
It is used to host my Python based FitTracker application.

As of now, the website is used so user's can register to the FitTracker software and download the Python based application.

Axios was used to send/receive request to the Python based API I wrote.


## Future updates:

- Authentication page (login/profile) will be created
- Python based software will be phased out once its funtionalities become available in the React website
- Phone compatibility optimizations
